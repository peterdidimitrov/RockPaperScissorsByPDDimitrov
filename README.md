# RockPaperScissorsByPDDimitrov
This is a simple console game "Rock Paper Scissors".

Rock Paper Scissors is a zero sum game that is usually played by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome.
The rock is when you place your hand into the form of a simple fist.
The paper is when you place your hand in an outstretched position.
This is when you hold your fist with your index and middle finger pointing outwards in a V shape.

Rules:
1. Rock wins against scissors; 
2. Paper wins against rock; 
3. Scissors wins against paper. 

If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
